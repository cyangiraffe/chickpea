# This file contains functions for generating various photonic waveguide paths

#   path                            - wrapper around pya.round_corners
#   s_bend(length, height)          - generates an s-bend, maximizing bend 
#                                     radius for the specified length and height
#   s_bend(bend_angle, bend_radius) - generates an s-bend with specified bend
#                                     parameters
#   s_bend(length, bend_radius)     - generates an s-bend with specified bend
#                                     radius and total length
#   s_bend(height, bend_radius)     - generates an s-bend with specified bend
#                                     radius and total height
#   s_bend_path_length              - calculates path length of the s-bend
#                                     generated by s_bend when supplied with
#                                     corresponding parameters.
