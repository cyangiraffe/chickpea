This file contained some files that would act as templates for 
automatically generating scripts that would set up a Lumerical
simulation that a correspondingly generated directional coupler
GDS could be inserted into. As the direcitonal coupler
generating functions have been updated, these scripts fell
behind, and the use case is limited enough that I don't 
intend on ever updating the functions that use these tempaltes.
