def _boolrelextrema(data, comparator, axis=0, order=1, mode='clip'):
    """
    Calculate the relative extrema of `data`.
    Relative extrema are calculated by finding locations where
    ``comparator(data[n], data[n+1:n+order+1])`` is True.
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Array in which to find the relative extrema.
    comparator : callable
        Function to use to compare two data points.
        Should take two arrays as arguments.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to select from `data`.  Default is 0.
    order : int, optional
        How many points on each side to use for the comparison
        to consider ``comparator(n,n+x)`` to be True.
    mode : str, optional
        How the edges of the vector are treated.  'wrap' (wrap around) or
        'clip' (treat overflow as the same as the last (or first) element).
        Default 'clip'.  See numpy.take
    Returns
    -------
    extrema : ndarray
        Boolean array of the same shape as `data` that is True at an extrema,
        False otherwise.

    --------
    argrelmax, argrelmin
    Examples
    --------
    >>> testdata = np.array([1,2,3,2,1])
    >>> _boolrelextrema(testdata, np.greater, axis=0)
    array([False, False,  True, False, False], dtype=bool)

def argrelmin(data, axis=0, order=1, mode='clip'):
    """
    Calculate the relative minima of `data`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Array in which to find the relative minima.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to select from `data`.  Default is 0.
    order : int, optional
        How many points on each side to use for the comparison
        to consider ``comparator(n, n+x)`` to be True.
    mode : str, optional
        How the edges of the vector are treated.
        Available options are 'wrap' (wrap around) or 'clip' (treat overflow
        as the same as the last (or first) element).
        Default 'clip'. See numpy.take
    Returns
    -------
    extrema : tuple of ndarrays
        Indices of the minima in arrays of integers.  ``extrema[k]`` is
        the array of indices of axis `k` of `data`.  Note that the
        return value is a tuple even when `data` is one-dimensional.
    See Also
    --------
    argrelextrema, argrelmax, find_peaks
    Notes
    -----
    This function uses `argrelextrema` with np.less as comparator. Therefore it
    requires a strict inequality on both sides of a value to consider it a
    minimum. This means flat minima (more than one sample wide) are not detected.
    In case of one-dimensional `data` `find_peaks` can be used to detect all
    local minima, including flat ones, by calling it with negated `data`.
    .. versionadded:: 0.11.0
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.signal import argrelmin
    >>> x = np.array([2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0])
    >>> argrelmin(x)
    (array([1, 5]),)
    >>> y = np.array([[1, 2, 1, 2],

    return argrelextrema(data, np.less, axis, order, mode)


def argrelmax(data, axis=0, order=1, mode='clip'):
    """
    Calculate the relative maxima of `data`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Array in which to find the relative maxima.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to select from `data`.  Default is 0.
    order : int, optional
        How many points on each side to use for the comparison
        to consider ``comparator(n, n+x)`` to be True.

        Available options are 'wrap' (wrap around) or 'clip' (treat overflow
        as the same as the last (or first) element).
        Default 'clip'.  See `numpy.take`.
    Returns
    -------
    extrema : tuple of ndarrays

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses `argrelextrema` with np.greater as comparator. Therefore

    maximum. This means flat maxima (more than one sample wide) are not detected.
